# OpenEVSE Hackery

This repo contains glue code to integrate an OpenEVSE Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ("charger") with a Selectronic SP Pro inverter (hybrid off grid inverter).

Plenty of choices in this repo are likely not applicable to your use case as it was put together while the OpenEVSE was in a weird place in my network (it couldn't see the rest of my network). A more generic solution would likely be to expose the data for MQTT from the SP Pro.

I wanted to learn some Typescript, so I've done that here.

# Quick start

```bash
$ nvm install
$ npm install
```
